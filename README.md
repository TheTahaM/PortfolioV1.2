# Taha's Website v1.2

An interactive and visually appealing personal webpage featuring smooth scroll animations, a fixed top navigation bar, and animated overlay text. As the user scrolls, images transition dynamically to create a seamless animation effect.

It's an updated version of my old portfolio site "Taha's Website v1", but in order to update it to my standards I had to recreate it from scratch. So I decided a new repo would be best.

## Features

- **Smooth Scroll Animation**: A series of images play in sequence as the user scrolls, providing a smooth animated effect on the canvas.
- **Responsive Fixed Navigation Bar**: The top navigation bar stays fixed, updating its opacity and blur effect as the user scrolls.
- **Fading Overlay Text**: Overlay text displays on the main page and fades away as the user scrolls down.
- **End Message**: A footer message appears when the user reaches the bottom of the page, linking to the store and showing the current version.

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A server to serve the HTML file if you need smooth loading for images; otherwise, you can simply open the HTML file in a browser for testing.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tahas-website.git
   cd tahas-website
